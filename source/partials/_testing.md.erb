If we need a way to make sure emails / SMS aren't sent to an actual User when interacting with the API, we'll need a way to set if the Company is in **"test mode"**, or if a given request is a test request.

To mark a request as a test, playing with the idea of appending `.test` to the URL of the endpoint. This will make the call use the Company's `test_email` & `test_phone`, or not send email/SMS if these aren't set.

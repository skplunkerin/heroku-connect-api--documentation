- **Required fields:**
  - code_type
      - Valid Options: `required_auth_code`, `auth_code`, `forgot_password`
  - **ONE OF THESE:**
      - find_by_apikey - _used to "send/re-send auth code to preferred contact method (unless contact_method is specified)_
      - find_by_email - _find account and send forgot password code via preferred contact method (unless contact_method is specified)_
      - find_by_phone - _find account and send forgot password code via preferred contact method (unless contact_method is specified)_
- **Optional fields:**
  - contact_method - _if this is not defined, API will use their 2FA contact preference_
      - Valid Options: `sms`, `email`, `call`

**NOTES:**

- To get the User APIKEY, save that info when the User successfully logs in or from other endpoints
- `code_type` will determine if 2FA code is required or not (i.e. for non-required Email confirm), or if password reset key is needed
- `contact_method` will determine how the code is sent to User
  - **NOTE:** for 2FA codes, the method specified here will determine how the code is set in the API (in addition to how the code is sent).<br/>
    _i.e. if current required 2FA is on SMS, but `contact_method` is set to Email (and `code_type` set to **required_auth_code**) then the new required 2FA will now be on Email instead of SMS._
